Feedback:
This assignment was much easier to understand, I think it's because it mostly deals with JavaScript. There's obvious opportunity for styling, however from a purely functional standpoint it's just JavaScript and of course understanding async. 
I did get stuck at one point because I didn't initially think to use await. After looking at the example and looking into await documentation I was able see what i was doing wrong and how to make my life easier.
